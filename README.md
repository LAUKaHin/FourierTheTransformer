# FourierTheTransformer
This repository contains examples on audio visualization, from import audio to convert it from time domain to frequency domain utilizing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Below are brief descriptions on different scripts:

## Audio_FFT_Visualizer.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook file show the whole process of FurierTheTransformer.py step by step. Here is the steps of the process:

### 1. Import the libraries
### 2. Set target mp3 and chose plt styling
### 3. Create project directory (if the project directory is not created)
### 4. Convert mp3 stereo channel to wav mono channel and read the wav file
### 5. Read all the frames and get the length
### 6. Do the FFT and show the result every frame and save it
### 7. Merge all image stram to video and save it as .mp4
### 8. Add audio to video

This file just for trial, short mp3 be processed is more recommended.

## Audio_FFT_Visualizer.py
This script do above steps automatically, because it takes time, it is recommended long mp3 be processed by this script.
